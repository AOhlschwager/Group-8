Project Boiler Plate for UWyo COSC 4950/5
=========================================

This is nothing more than a directory structure to use for starting a new project.  
It contains the following folders:

* **Source:** This is where you should place all of your source code.  If your project
  uses multiple languages, you may find it useful to have subdirectories, e.g.,
  Source/java, Source/html, Source/images, etc.  If you are using an IDE that has
  a project directory, you may wish to start the project here.  For example, the
  Source directory could contain an Xcode project repository or a VisualStudio
  project.

* **Documents:** Here will be the documents you write to describe your project.  The
  boiler plate includes a use case template and a sample use case.  Both of these
  are taken from [Cockburn's use cases website][1], which contains many other useful tips
  on writing effective use cases (as does his book).  The use cases are written
  down in [Markdown][2] format.  You may convert them to your word processor of
  choice.

* **Resources:** This is where you can place files that are useful to your project.
  For example, you may place here helpful articles downloaded from the internet.

Before you turn in a project, be sure to modify this file!  It should give me a good
description of the files and folders that you want me to look.  For example, if your
code is in Java, you may describe the most important Java packages and the order in
which I should view them to understand your code.
